## About the Game
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a classic hand game usually played between two people. Each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand. The possible shapes are:
- Rock (a fist)
- Paper (an open hand)
- Scissors (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)

The rules are simple:
- Rock crushes scissors
- Scissors cuts paper
- Paper covers rock

This program mimics the real-life game, where players show their hand gesture at the same time to determine the winner of each round.

## Program Flow
1. The program starts by asking you how many rounds you want to play.
2. It then initiates a countdown for the computer's choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
3. You input your choice (c, u, or t) indicating who you think won the round.
4. The program repeats steps 2-3 for the specified number of rounds.
5. After all rounds are completed, the program announces the winner based on the total score.

Enjoy playing Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer in the comfort of your terminal!
